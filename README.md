# PriceCalculator

Price Calculator is a CLI App to calculate prices for an inventory of products provided via a JSON file, eg:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Bread",
    "unit_price": "2.17",
    "discount": {
      "quantity": 3,
      "price": "6.0"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "Banana",
    "unit_price": "0.99"
  }
]
```

You can even provide a discount, and we're going to calculate everything for you from your awesome terminal ðŸš€


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'price_calculator'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install price_calculator

### OR

To install it locally.

```
  rake build
  rake install
```

## Usage

You need to provide an `inventory_file_path`, you can provide it using the flag `--inventory_file=path_to_inventory.json` or using an environment variable `INVENTORY_FILE_PATH`

To run it without install it. From project root path execute:

```
bundle exec exe/price_calculator order --inventory_file_path=./data/inventory.json
```

### Print current inventory

```
price_calculator pricing_table --inventory_file_path=./data/inventory.json

+--------+------------+------------+
|  Item  | Unit Price | Sale Price |
+--------+------------+------------+
| Milk   | $3.97      | 2 for $5.0 |
| Bread  | $2.17      | 3 for $6.0 |
| Banana | $0.99      |            |
| Apple  | $0.89      |            |
+--------+------------+------------+
```

- [X] Revisit naming (refactoring to make more sense to classes responsibility & structure)
- [X] Improve coverage
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Add utility module and extract some methods
- [ ] Validate attributes/data from inventory JSON file
- [ ] Manage order status?
- [ ] Persist/Update existence of products?
